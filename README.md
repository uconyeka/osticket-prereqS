When creating the VM, allow it to create a new Virtual Network (Vnet)

Part 2 (Installation)
Note: I wouldn't really consider this a “simple list” because the steps are just installing a bunch of prerequisite software, but you can use it as a guide to work through the lab. No need to try to memorize everything.
Create an Azure Virtual Machine Windows 10, 4 vCPUs
Name: Vm-osticket
Username: labuser (for example/whatever you chose)
Password: osTicketPassword1! (for example/whatever you chose)

Open this: Installation Files
We will use these files to install osTicket and some of the dependencies. I’m using this offline version to make sure everyone is using the same version of all the files :)
